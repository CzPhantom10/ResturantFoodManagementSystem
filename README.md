# Restaurant Food Management System

This project is a Restaurant Food Management System built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to manage food orders, track their cooking status, and see a countdown timer for each order. The system utilizes a First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm to handle multiple orders efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Orders**: Users can input customer names, food items, and estimated cooking times.
- **Order Processing**: Orders are processed in the order they are received, with a countdown timer showing the remaining cooking time.
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: The application dynamically updates the status and remaining time for each order.
- **Order Completion Notification**: When the cooking time reaches zero, the order is marked as "Completed" and ready to be served.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Streamlit library
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/restaurant-food-management-system.git
   cd restaurant-food-management-system

2. **How to run**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

   
## Usage
   
- Enter the customer name, food item, and estimated cooking time in seconds.
- Click on "Add Order" to add the order to the system.
- After adding all orders, click on "Submit All Orders" to start processing.
- Watch the countdown timer for each order, and see the status update in real-time.
- When the timer reaches zero, the order will be marked as "Completed."
